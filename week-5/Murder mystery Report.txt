2. The murder entry from that day gave us the following information:- "Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave"."

3. So we sorted the house data of the 'Northwestern Dr' in decreasing order to find the number of the last house which is owned by witness 1.
